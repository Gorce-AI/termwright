### Patch Changes

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Document the public installation, lifecycle, durability, authentication, and
  security contracts of the desktop host and native-host infrastructure packages.

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Keep shared probe build outputs immutable while the Native Host is running,
  with a pre-host content fingerprint that builds missing fresh-clone inputs,
  rebuilds stale inputs, and rejects source or artifact changes inside test
  workers. Settle deadline, process-exit and Ink render race branches during
  teardown. A cancelled desktop control bind now remains owned until a late
  listener is closed, so startup rollback cannot leave an orphaned socket or
  named pipe. Promote Vitest
  async-handle leak evidence into a non-certifying infrastructure result.

  Compare exact reference and candidate revisions on one macOS runner in a fixed
  reference/candidate/candidate/reference sequence. The paired gate binds the
  toolchain, measurement harness, controller, round order, subject commit, CI
  attempt and every raw report with SHA-256 provenance; Bun/OpenTUI is mandatory,
  and process and file-descriptor leaks remain exact-zero invariants.

  Move native run manifests to schema v3 with host-monotonic total duration and
  per-attempt start/finish offsets. Validate those intervals against the run
  boundary and reject v2 or internally inconsistent timing evidence.

  The independent Windows Vitest/PTY reliability harness now invokes the exact
  lockfile-backed Vitest entry point directly through Node instead of relying on
  non-executable `.cmd` shell shims.
