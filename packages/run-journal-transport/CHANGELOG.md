### Patch Changes

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Make local endpoint shutdown a causal barrier on Windows and POSIX. Accepted semantic sockets are now destroyed before listener completion, late connections are rejected during shutdown, and listener cleanup still completes when an individual socket teardown reports an error.

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Consolidate authenticated local IPC framing, hostile-input decoding, typed
  envelopes, token comparison, and endpoint lifecycle into one shared transport.
  Journal shutdown now drains every already-received append before its close
  barrier resolves and reports persistence failures after endpoint cleanup.

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Document the public installation, lifecycle, durability, authentication, and
  security contracts of the desktop host and native-host infrastructure packages.

- [#106](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/pull/106) [`e0b78f5`](https://github.com/Gorce-AI/termwright/commit/e0b78f525888014f8ea08d3817abbeb407c3df6e) Thanks [@SarukMyskam](https://github.com/SarukMyskam)! - Keep the local Native Host profile at two Vitest forks while retaining capacity
  for four simultaneous terminals. Worker journal cleanup now drains and closes
  its socket on every path, and its close barrier resolves only after the socket
  has actually closed, so teardown correctness does not depend on serializing the
  monorepo or leaving transport handles for process termination. The Native Host
  also drains Vitest's worker pool before advancing its lifecycle, while run
  history validates attempt ordering in one pass instead of blocking worker
  termination with work proportional to attempts multiplied by journal events.
  Persistent-host verdicts are now derived only from the native tasks selected
  for the current cycle, so Vitest modules retained from an earlier cycle cannot
  contaminate later skip evidence. Explicit partial Vitest catalogues no longer
  make unrelated repository-wide required skips appear stale, while every
  observed skip still needs one exact declaration. Static Ink probe metadata
  checks no longer load the render-session runtime.
